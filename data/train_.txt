i O 
hope O

the O

will O 
leave O

soon O 
, O 
and O 
we O

let O 
me O 
set O 
aside O 
the O 
hypocrisy O 
of O 
a O 
man O 
who O 
became B-Elect-T 
president B-Position 
because O 
of O 
a O 
lawsuit O 
trying O 
to O 
eliminate O 
everybody O 
else O 
's O 
lawsuits O 
, O 
but O 
instead O 
focus O 
on O 
his O 
own O 
experience O 

now O 
, O 
i O 
would O 
hope O 
that O 
sooner O 
rather O 
than O 
later O 
we O 
could O 
see O 
a O 
civilian O 
government O 
emerge O 
in O 
iraq O 
, O 
a O 
democratically O 
elected B-Elect-T 
one O 
, O 
that O 
there O 
'd O 
be O 
more O 
cooperation O 
from O 
the O 
international O 
community O 
, O 
on O 
both O 
the O 
peacekeeping O 
side O 
as O 
well O 
as O 
the O 
political O 
restructuring O 
that O 
's O 
necessary O 
in O 
iraq O 

he O 
lost O 
an O 
election B-Elect-T 
to O 
a O 
dead O 
man B-Person 

paul O 
, O 
as O 
i O 
understand O 
your O 
definition O 
of O 
a O 
political O 
-- O 
of O 
a O 
professional O 
politician O 
based O 
on O 
that O 
is O 
somebody O 
who B-Person 
is O 
elected B-Elect-T 
to O 
public B-Position 
office I-Position 

he B-Person 
won O 
his O 
first O 
election B-Elect-T 
in O 
1928 B-Time-Starting 
, O 
the B-Position 
office I-Position 
of I-Position 
the I-Position

we O 
've O 
seen O 
in O 
the B-Time-Within 
past I-Time-Within 
in O 
bosnia B-Place 
for O 
example O 
, O 
you O 
held O 
elections B-Elect-T 
and O 
all O 
of O 
the O 
old O 
ethnic O 
thugs B-Person 
get O 
into O 
power O 
because O 
they O 
have O 
organization O 
and O 
they O 
have O 
money O 
and O 
they O 
stop O 
the O 
process O 
of O 
genuine O 
building O 
of O 
democracy O 

twice O 
before O 
becoming B-Elect-T 
president B-Position 
he B-Person 
was O 
so O 
sick O 
, O 
a O 
priest O 
was O 
brought O 
in O 
to O 
give O 
him O 
last O 
rites O 

dallek O 
says O 
kennedy O 
's O 
brushes O 
with O 
death O 
, O 
combined O 
with O 
his O 
t O 
deaths O 
of O 
his O 
sister O 
and O 
brother O 
, O 
fueled O 
the O 
ambition O 
to O 
led O 
him O 
to O 
become O 
the O 
youngest O 
person B-Person 
elected B-Elect-T 
president B-Position 
in O 
american B-Entity 
history O 

my O 
focus O 
is O 
on O 
re-electing B-Elect-T

bush B-Person 
and O 
dick O 
cheney O 
next B-Time-Within

maybe O 
they O 
're O 
jossling O 
for O

's O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
the O 
next B-Elect-T 
speaker B-Position 

some O 
of O 
the O 
national O 
democratic O 
operatives O 
think O 
john B-Person 
edwards I-Person 
is O 
going O 
to O 
run O 
for O 
president O 
and O 
that O 
he O 
ought O 
to O 
get O 
out O 
and O 
concentrate O 
on O 
being O 
reelected B-Elect-T 
senator B-Position 
of O 
north O 
carolina O 
which O 
wo O 
n't O 
be O 
easy O 

it O 
was O 
a O 
very O 
brutal O 
election B-Elect-T 

did O 
you O 
vote O 
in O 
the O 
recent B-Time-Within 
us B-Place 
presidential O 
election B-Elect-T 

well O 
, O 
you O 
kind O 
of O 
hit O 
on O 
some O 
of O 
my O 
sentiments O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
i O 
'm O 
a O 
fifty-year- O 
old O 
black O 
male O 
, O 
and O 
this O 
was O 
my O 
first O 
election B-Elect-T 
that O 
i O 
participated O 
in O 

ever O 
, O 
i O 
usually O 
try O 
to O 
stay O 
out O 
of O 
the O 
main O 
party O 
, O 
because O 
i O 
think O 
, O 
and O 
this O 
last O 
election B-Elect-T 
showed O 
that O 
both O 
are O 
very O 
brutal O 

and O 
, O 
ah O 
-- O 
i O 
mean O 
, O 
and O 
, O 
and O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
it O 
has O 
to O 
do O 
-- O 
and O 
then O 
, O 
i O 
just O 
did O 
n't O 
know O 
much O 
, O 
john B-Person 
edwards I-Person 
seemed O 
nice O 
, O 
but O 
he O 
just O 
, O 
you O 
know O 
, O 
he O 
was O 
just O 
, O 
he O 
just O 
got O 
elected B-Elect-T 
to O 
the O 
senate O 
, O 
and O 
, O 
i O 
was O 
n't O 
really O 
familiar O 
too O 
much O 
with O 
hi- O 
i O 
mean O 
, O 
i O 
think O 
it O 
's O 
great O 
that O 
he O 
got O 
into O 
the O 
vice O 
presidential O 
role O 
, O 
but O 
-- O 
again O 
, O 
it O 
's O 
the O 
whole O 
parties O 
that O 
i O 
'm O 
really O 
not O 
really O 
i O 
do O 
n't O 
like O 
their O 
policies O 

yeah O 
, O 
i O 
guess O 
the O 
elections B-Elect-T 
, O 
ah O 
-- O 
basically O 
, O 
who O 
did O 
you O 
vote O 
for O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
vice O 
presidential O 
candidates B-Person 
, O 
and O 
why O 
, O 
and O 
i O 
'll O 
be O 
honest O 
with O 
you O 

yeah O 
, O 
i- O 
in O 
fact O 
, O 
i O 
thought O 
we O 
already O 
had O 
a O 
discussion O 
on O 
this O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
about O 
elections B-Elect-T 
some O 
time O 
back O 
, O 
but O 
i O 
guess O 
it O 
was O 
-- O 
question O 
was O 
framed O 
differently O 
, O 
i O 
guess O 

um O 
, O 
man O 
i O 
thought O 
i O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
put O 
this O 
whole O 
election B-Elect-T 
stuff O 
behind O 
me O 

and O 
, O 
um O 
, O

, O 
um O 
-- O 
the O 
, O

ju- O 
just O 
give O 
you O 
a O 
brief O 
-- O 
summary O 
, O 
i O 
felt O

pretty O 
strong O

-- O 
uh O 
-- O 
mm O 
, O 
i O 
do O 
n't O 
know O 
, O 
i O 
guess O 
just O 
in O 
terms O 
of O 
policy O 
i O 
did O 
n't O 
-- O 
i O 
did O 
n't O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
find O 
-- O 
that O 
as O 
compelling O 
as O 
just O 
-- O 
the O 
personality O 
of O 
-- O 
the O 
different O

that O 
, O 
in O

killed O 
, O 
and O 
their O

were O 
now O 
at O

well O 
, O 
as O

we O 
also O

that O 
12 O

, O 
coalition O

remain O 
largely O 
in O

what B-Artifact 
was O 
formerly O

, O 
now O 
renamed O 
by O 
the O

it O 
would O 
be O 
deadly O 
to O 
let O

employ O 
i O

support O

there O 
's O 
a O 
new O 
poll O 
out O 
this O 
morning O 
, O 
abc O 
news O 
washington O 
post O 
poll O 
that O 
suggests O 
that O 
most O 
americans O 
would O 
support O 
u.s. O 
military O 
action O 
against O 
iran O 
in O 
order O 
to O 
keep O 
the O 
country B-Buyer 
from O 
acquiring B-Transfer-Ownership-T

a O 
toy O 
company B-Buyer 
bought B-Transfer-Ownership-T 
the O 
silver B-Artifact

so O 
they O 
could O 
make O

it B-Artifact

harrod O 
harrod B-Buyer

who O 
would O 
n't O 
trust O 
its O

to O 
anyone O 
else O 

interesting O 
point O 
here O 
also O 
, O 
people O 
are O 
suggesting O 
he B-Buyer 
may O 
be O 
raising O 
this O 
money O 
to O 
buy B-Transfer-Ownership-T 
those O 
atlanta O 
sports O 
teams B-Artifact 
that O 
apparently O 
are O 
on O 
the O

a B-Time-Within

months I-Time-Within 
before I-Time-Within 

this O 
was O 
the O 
italian B-Seller

that O

that O 
was O 
captured B-Transfer-Ownership-T 
by O 
palestinian O 
terrorists B-Buyer 
back O 
in O 
1985 B-Time-Within 
and O 
some O 
may O 
remember O 
the O 
story O 
of O 
leon O 
clinghover O 
, O 
he O 
was O 
in O 
a O 
cheal O 
chair O 
and O 
the O 
terrorists O 
shot O 
him O 
and O 
pushed O 
him O 
over O 
the O 
side O 
of O 
the O 
ship O 
into O 
the O 
mediterranean O 
where O 
he O 
obviously O 
, O 
died O 

we O 
, O 
of O 
course O 
, O 
will O 
bring O 
the O 
word O 
to O 
you O 
just O 
as O 
soon O 
as O 
the O 
army B-Buyer 
and O 
coalition O 
forces B-Buyer 
do O 
take B-Transfer-Ownership-T 
control O 
of O 
saddam B-Artifact 
hussein I-Artifact 
international I-Artifact 
airport I-Artifact 
, O 
just O 
on O 
the O

of O

that O 
it O 
is O 
very O 
difficult O 
to O 
discern O 
whether O 
or O 
not O 
that O 
is O 
, O 
in O 
point O 
of O 
fact O 
, O 
the O 
missiles O 
that O 
we O 
have O 
become O 
accustomed O 
to O 
striking O 
baghdad O 
and O 
its O 
environs O 
, O 
or O 
whether O 
it O 
is O 
the O 
large O 
2,000 O

jdam O 
bombs O 
that O 
have O 
been O 
striking O 
targets O 
sclected O 
by O 
the O 
coalition O 
in O 
baghdad O 
, O 
or O 
whether O 
these O

now O 
represent O 
artillery O

as O

continues O 
to O 
take O

in O 
an O 
unused O 
factory O 
in O 
the O 
southern O

of O 
that O 
city O 

this O 
is O 
one O 
technique O 
, O 
one O 
possible O 
way O 
u.s. O 
forces B-Buyer 
might O 
seize B-Transfer-Ownership-T 
a O 
bridge B-Artifact 
, O 
a O 
bridge O 
that O 
might O 
be O 
defended O 
by O 
iraqis B-Seller 

in O 
which O 
, O 
the O 
state B-Buyer 
of O 
israel O 
buys B-Transfer-Ownership-T 
-- O 
many O 
expensive O 
military O

, O 
ah O 
, O 
which O 
is O 
used O 
to O 
-- O

-- O 
to O 
kill O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
palestinians O 

well O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
where O 
they B-Seller 
were O 
going O 
to O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
give B-Transfer-Ownership-T 
them B-Beneficiary

ninety-six O

just O 
recently O

whoa O 
, O 
my O 
radio O 

y'all B-Artifact 
recently B-Time-Within 
got O 
bought B-Transfer-Ownership-T 

and O 
bought B-Transfer-Ownership-T 
our O 
company B-Artifact 
out O 
from O 
our O 
previous O 
owner B-Seller 

within O 
weeks O 
after O 
taking B-Transfer-Ownership-T 
charge O 
of O 
a O 
public O 
company B-Artifact 
that O 
had O 
even O 
managed O

, O 
without O

any O

whatsoever O 
in O 
the O

the O 
poor O 
of O 
the O 
city O 
$ O 
15 O

more O 
a O

a O

of O 
billions O 
of O 
dollars O 
, O 
and O 
then O 
refused O

, O 
knowing O 
the O 
company B-Seller 
has O 
no O 
legal O 
recourse O 
except O 
lengthy O 
international O 
arbitration O 
, O 
and O 
will O 
likely O 
sell B-Transfer-Ownership-T

it O 
killed B-Die-T

have O

to O 
be O 
with O

uh- O 
-- O 
kill B-Die-T

, O 
now O

i O 
do O 
n't O

about O

i O 
-- O 
told O 
myself O 
, O 
if O

yeah O 
, O 
he B-Agent 
probably O 
did B-Die-T 

uh O 
, O 
if O

did O

i O

i O

oh O 
, O 
i O 
'm O

i O

uh O

more O 
trying O

suddenly O 

lovely O 
, O

an O 
autopsy O

her O

his O

i O

about O

you O 
are O 
speaking O

between O 
her O 
version O 
and O 
the O

of O 
his B-Victim

of O 
death B-Die-T 

people O 
are O 
interested O 
to O 
know O 
how O 
she O 
's O 
doing O 
after O 
having O 
lost B-Die-T 
such O 
a O 
big O 
part B-Victim 
of O 
her O 
life O 
, O 
and O 
this O 
really O 
was O 
more O 
what O 
the O 
interview O 
was O 
about O 

what O 
i O 
think O 
was O 
quite O 
appalling O 
from O 
what O 
dana O 
said O 
on O 
the O 
oprah O 
show O 
was O 
that O 
the O 
doctors B-Agent 
wanted O 
to O 
pull B-Die-T 
the O 
life O 
support O 
from O 
chris B-Victim 
*without O 
her O 
being O 
there O 

and O 
the O 
hmong O 
sits O

while O 
kim B-Agent 
ii I-Agent 
and O 
bush O 
jr. O 
kill B-Die-T 
each O 
other B-Victim 
... O 
now O 
wouldn O 
; O 
t O 
that O 
be O 
a O 
scene O 
to O 
view O 

the O 
religion O 
that O 
is O 
afraid O 
of O 
science O 
dishonors O 
god O 
and O 
commits O 
suicide B-Die-T 

who O 
really O 
benefits O 
from O 
his B-Victim 
death B-Die-T 

although O 
i O 
would O 
think O 
the O 
israeli O 
media O 
, O 
who O 
were O 
blamed O 
for O 
hushing O 
up O 
haza B-Victim 
's O 
cause O 
of O 
death B-Die-T 
, O 
would O 
take O 
a O 
unique O 
pleasure O 
in O 
making O 
the O 
most O 
of O 
arafat O 
's O 
, O 
if O 
all O 
this O 
was O 
true O 

yasser B-Victim 
arafat I-Victim 
murdered B-Die-T 

i O 
do O 
n't O 
doubt O 
that O 
this O 
method O 
has O 
been O 
used O 
to O 
remove B-Die-T 
various O 
thorns B-Victim 
over B-Time-Within 
the I-Time-Within 
years I-Time-Within 
, O 
but O 
why O 
on O 
earth O 
would O 
israel O 
have O 
wanted O 
to O 
get O 
rid O 
of O 
the O 
shah O 

no O 
, O 
they O 
do O 
n't O 
. O 
the O 
`` O 
suspicious O 
evidence O 
'' O 
is O 
simply O 
that O 
arafat B-Victim 
did O 
not O 
look O 
particularly O 
near O 
death B-Die-T 
when O 
he O 
was O 
removed O 
from O 
his O 
hq O 

he B-Victim 
appeared O 
alert O 
and O 
functioning O 
, O 
certainly O 
not O 
a B-Time-After 
week I-Time-After 
away O 
from O 
death B-Die-T 
from O 
wasting O

we O 
got O 
to O

a O

of O

( O

the O

( O

once O 
again O 
, O 
i O 
'm O 
not O 
diminishing O 
the O 
horror O 
of O 
any O 
individual O 
murder B-Die-T 
, O 
just O 
trying O 
to O 
get O 
it O 
into O 
perspective O 

yet O 
again O 
i O 
notice O 
that O 
the O 
media O 
see O 
gays O 
as O 
'invisible O 
' O 
when O 
it O 
comes O 
to O 
holocaust B-Die-T 
day O 

i O 
was O 
watching O 
the O 
bbc O 
news O 
this O 
morning O 
and O 
they O 
interviewed O 
the O 
man O 
who O 
is O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
in O 
charge O 
of O 
holocaust B-Die-T 
day O 
, O 
certainly O 
in O 
the O 
future O 

records O 
appear O 
to O 
show O 
that O 
50000 O 
_men_ O 
were O 
convicted O 
of O 
homosexuality O 
during O 
the O 
nazi O 
rule O 
, O 
finding O 
out O 
how O 
many B-Victim 
were O 
sent O 
to O 
a O 
camp O 
and O 
killed B-Die-T 
there B-Place 
is O 
more O 
difficult O 
especially O 
as O 
some O 
who O 
were O 
sent O 
to O 
normal O 
jails O 
were O 
transferred O 
to O 
camps O 
at O 
the O 
end O 
of O 
their O 
sentence O 
, O 
but O 
10-15k O 
seems O 
reasonable O 

i O 
think O 
the O 
chance O 
of O 
their O 
being O 
only O 
10000 O 
who O 
were O 
homosexual O 
amongst O 
the O 
how O 
ever O 
million B-Victim 
were O 
killed B-Die-T 
in O 
the O

is O 
rather O 
small O 

the O 
holocaust B-Die-T 
of O 
the O

zigeuner B-Victim

, O 
the O 
reason O

we B-Attacker

) O

put O 
the O

the O 
problem O

was O 
that O 
the O 
guy B-Target

put O

happen O 
in O 
this O

you O

what O 
happens O

as O 
you O

every O

in O

right O 
here O 
, O 
and O 
that O 
's O 
always O 
the O 
problem O 
, O 
because O 
as O 
you O

, O 
you O 
've O

you O

them O 
having O 
their B-Attacker 
sectors O

yes O 
, O 
i O 
'm O 
not O 
saying O 
take O 
the O

it O 
means O 
when O 
you O 
take O 
the O 
threat O

of O 
the O 
table O 
, O 
you O 
're O 
likely O 
to O 
stop O

but O 
i O 
think O 
president O

should O 
get O 
credit O 
for O 
pushing O 
to O 
instructions O 
and O 
backing O 
them O 
up O 
with O 
the O 
threat O 
of O 
force B-Attack-T 

saddam B-Target 
would O 
n't O 
be O 
destroying O 
missiles O 
unless O 
he O 
thought O 
he O 
was O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
destroyed B-Attack-T 
if O 
he O 
did O 
n't O 

president O 
bush O 
wants O 
the O 
security O 
council O 
to O 
explicitly O 
authorize O 
force B-Attack-T 
against O 
iraq O 
, O 
and O 
his O 
press O 
secretary O 
today O 
remained O 
optimistic O 
that O 
in O 
the O 
end O 
, O 
that O 
's O 
just O 
what O 
he O 
'll O 
get O 

it O 
does O 
n't O 
mean O 
we B-Attacker 
have O 
to O 
go O 
to O 
war B-Attack-T 

i O 
'm O 
saying O 
we B-Attacker 
do O 
n't O 
need O 
to O 
use O 
force B-Attack-T 
right O 
now O 

we O 
do O 
n't O 
need O 
war B-Attack-T 

they O 
're O 
not O 
pointing O 
out O 
that O 
inspections O 
are O 
working O 
only O 
because O 
there O 
's O 
the O 
credible O 
threat O 
of O 
war B-Attack-T 

on O 
this O 
ash O 
wednesday O 
, O 
the O 
pope O 
asks O 
catholics O 
to O 
fast O 
for O 
peace O 
and O 
he O 
asks O 
president O 
bush O 
to O 
work O 
for O 
peace O 
, O 
while O 
the O 
white O 
house O 
sends O 
out O 
colin O 
powell O 
to O 
make O 
yet O 
another O 
case O 
for O 
war B-Attack-T 

the O 
essence O 
of O 
the O 
american B-Attacker 
case O 
for O 
war B-Attack-T 
against O 
saddam B-Target 
hussein I-Target 

there O 
is O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
fighting B-Attack-T 
in O 
this O 
area B-Place 

so O 
they O 
're O 
still O 
out O 
there O 
. O 
but O 
the O 
air O 
power O 
and O 
the O 
air O 
package O 
that O 
we B-Attacker 
take O 
to O 
the O 
fight B-Attack-T 
, O 
we O 
continue O 
to O 
be O 
effective O 

after O 
he O 
told O 
us O 
that O 
, O 
we O 
asked O 
him O 
during O 
his O 
missions O 
, O 
and O 
he O 
's O 
flown O 
about O 
30 O 
in O 
the B-Time-Within 
last I-Time-Within 
two I-Time-Within 
weeks I-Time-Within 
, O 
we O 
asked O 
him O 
does O 
he O 
still O 
have O 
any O 
artillery B-Instrument 
being O 
fired B-Attack-T 
at O 
him B-Target 

with O 
u.s. O 
forces O 
rolling O 
closer O 
and O 
closer O 
to O 
baghdad O 
, O 
the O 
military O 
seems O 
to O 
be O 
zeroing O 
in O 
on O 
the O 
ground O 
war B-Attack-T 

i O 
will O 
be O 
talking O 
with O 
a O

the O

foreign O

joe O

ahead O 
, O 
for O 
his O 
take O 
on O 
how O 
the O 
war B-Attack-T 
is O 
going O 

but O 
, O 
as O 
it O 
has O 
from O 
the O 
beginning O 
, O 
air O 
power O 
remains O 
an O 
important O 
part O 
of O 
the O 
battle B-Attack-T 

yesterday B-Time-Within 
i B-Target 
was O 
up O 
just O

and O 
then O 
the O 
army B-Attacker

the O

move O

it O 
's O 
a O

until O 
this O

launched B-Attack-T 
some O 
155 O

that O

at O

were O 
seven O

from O

that O

reason O 
we O 
had O 
22 O 
democratic O 
senators O

, O 
is O 
because O 
of O 
the O 
civil B-Attack-T 
war I-Attack-T 
and O 
because O 
of O 
what O 
we O 
thought O 
was O 
a O 
heavy O 
hand O 
of O 
the O 
federal O 
government O 
all O 
the O 
time O 

bob O 
, O 
i O 
think O 
that O 
the O 
reason O 
everybody O 
in O 
the O 
south O 
-- O 
you O 
know O 
, O 
first O 
of O 
all O 
, O 
we O 
were O 
-- O 
when O 
franklin O 
roosevelt O 
was O 
elected O

, O 
we O 
had O 
been O 
living O 
what O 
we O 
thought O 
was O 
still O 
a O 
conquered O 
nation O 
after O 
the O 
civil B-Attack-T 
war I-Attack-T 

these O 
people O 
have O 
been O 
without O 
food O 
or O 
water O 
supplies O 
since O 
the O

began O 

when O 
we O 
return O 
, O 
americans O 
this O

are O 
marching O 
against O 
the O

in O 
support O 
of O 
the O

when O 
we O 
come O 
back O 
, O 
one O 
of O 
the O 
many O 
sad O 
aspects O 
of O 
this O 
war B-Attack-T 
, O 
humanitarian O 
aid O 
rushed O 
to O 
people O 
who O 
need O 
it O 
but O 
not O 
everybody O 
gets O 
what O 
they O 
came O 
for O 

it O 
will O 
be O 
attack B-Attack-T 
the O 
iraqi O 
regime B-Target 

hopefully O 
it O 
will O 
be O 
a O 
short O 
war B-Attack-T 

we O 
hate O 
any O 
state B-Attacker 
in O 
war B-Attack-T 
here O 

how O 
do O 
you O 
feel O 
though O 
seeing O 
pictures O 
of O 
civilians B-Target 
injured O 
in O 
the O 
bombings B-Attack-T 

we O 
get O 
reports O 
that O 
these O 
civilians B-Target 
especially O 
in O 
the O 
( O 
inaudible O 
) O 
population B-Target 
have O 
been O 
attacked B-Attack-T 
by O 
the O 
iraqi O 
regime B-Attacker 
themselves O 
so O 
they O 
ca O 
n't O 
blame O 
the O 
american O 
and O 
said O 
look O 
what O 
the O 
american O 
doing O

the O 
question O 
of O 
whether O 
we B-Attacker 
go O 
to O

not O 
is O 
strictly O 
a O

these B-Instrument

we O

then O 
they O 
can O 
make O 
( O

) O 
if O 
they B-Attacker 
want O 
to O 
maybe O 
avoid O 
that O 
area O 
or O 
go O 
ahead O 
and O 
go O 
out O 
and O 
engage B-Attack-T 
those O 
folks B-Target 

definitely O 
put O 
up O

when O 
you O

we O 
will O

back O 
later O

the O

that O 
europe O 
is O 
against O 
the O

on O 
humanitarian O 
and O 
moral O 
grounds O 
, O 
but O 
the O 
u.s. O

profit O 
for O 
the O

the O 
people O 
are O 
against O 
it B-Attack-T 

i O 
wonder O 
why O 
they O 
protest O 
the O 
war B-Attack-T 
with O 
iraq B-Place 

that O 
europe O 
is O 
against O 
the O

the O

but O 
it O 
has O 
nothing O 
to O 
do O 
whether O

go O

not O 

he O

trying O

lead O 
us O 
into O 
a O 
war B-Attack-T 
against O 
one B-Target 
of O 
his O 
valued O 
customers O 

what O 
does O 
that O 
have O 
to O 
do O 
with O 
the O 
war B-Attack-T 
in O 
iraq B-Place 

i O 
do O 
n't O 
believe O 
for O 
a O 
minute O 
that O 
this O 
is O 
a O 
war B-Attack-T 
for O 
oil O 

now O 
, O 
the O 
reason O 
that O 
france O 
, O 
russia O 
and O 
germany O 
are O 
against O 
war B-Attack-T 
is O 
because O 
they O 
have O 
democracies O 

i O 
think O 
it O 
's O 
unwise O 
, O 
it B-Attack-T 
's O 
unjust O 
, O 
it O 
's O 
unwarranted O 
, O 
but O 
i O 
do O 
n't O 
think O 
it O 
's O 
about O 
oil O 

i O 
know O 
during O 
the O 
war O 
, O 
before O 
the O 
war B-Attack-T 
, O 
you O 
were O 
very O 
concerned O 
about O 
the O 
position O 
of O 
the O 
syrian O 
government O 
, O 
cooperating O

certainly O 
, O 
our O

was O 
not O

off O 
of O 
1991 O 

it O 
was O 
to O 
remove O

, O 
and O 
it O

that O 
something O

out O

but O 
right O 
now O 
you O 
're O 
open-minded O 
as O 
far O 
as O 
syria O 
on O 
whether O 
they O 
will O 
crack O 
down O 
on O

, O 
take O 
some O 
of O 
the O 
other O 
steps O 
that O 
you O

it B-Target

that O 
there O 
are O

basically O

five O 
huge O

and O 
i O 
was O 
just O 
curious O 
if O 
you O 
feel O 
that O 
the O 
attack B-Attack-T 
on O 
iraq O 
would O 
actually O 
open O 
a O 
pandora O 
's O 
box O 
in O 
other O 
middle O 
eastern O 
countries O 
that O 
we O 
are O 
known O 
to O 
aid O 
and O 
harbor O 
terrorists O 
, O 
such O 
as O 
syria O 
and O 
iran O 

on O 
the O 
other O 
hand O 
, O 
the O

is O 
pretty O

, O 
filled O 
with O 
people B-Attacker 
who O 
already O 
hate O 
americans O 
and O 
seek O 
to O 
do O 
america O 
harm B-Attack-T 

well O 
, O 
this O 
is O 
something O 
that O 
we O 
've O 
been O 
trying O 
to O 
get O 
a O 
grip O 
on O 
for O 
years O 
, O 
exactly O 
what O 
the O 
iraqi O 
people O 
feel O 
and O 
also O 
that O 
i O 
think O 
the O 
best O 
evidence O 
that O 
we O 
had O 
before O 
the O 
attack B-Attack-T 
began O 
was O 
that O 
iraqis O 
do O 
, O 
they O 
despise O 

chances O 
are O 
the O 
iraqis O 
are O 
going O 
to O 
continue O 
to O 
stick O 
with O 
what O 
we O

been O 
the O 
surprising O 
level O 
of O

you O 
're O 
telling O 
me O 
your O 
sense O 
is O 
that O 
the O

beginning O

there O 
is O 
a O 
significant O 
difference O 
, O 
of O

in O 
the O 
last O 
gulf B-Place 
war B-Attack-T 
, O 
you O 
had O 
arab O

on O 
the O

it O 
gives O 
you O 
a O 
sense O 
of O 
, O 
perhaps O 
what O 
50 B-Time-Holds 
years I-Time-Holds 
of O 
tension O 
and O 
war B-Attack-T 
will O 
do O 
to O 
your O 
mentality O 

as O 
we B-Place 
have O 
the O 
strikes O 
overseas O 
throughout O 
iraq O 
, O 
there O 
will O 
be O 
retaliatory O

, O 
either O 
by O 
organized O

people B-Attacker 
against O

counterproductive O

, O 
you O 
know O 
, O 
they- O 
you O 
want O 
them B-Attacker 
to O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
fight B-Attack-T 
, O 
you O 
know O 

yeah O 
, O 
i O 
do O 
n't O 
think O 
he B-Target 
was O 
poisoned B-Attack-T 

he O 
he O 
seems O 
like O 
a O 
guy O 
who B-Target 
is O 
much O 
more O 
comfortable O 
-- O 
being O 
under O 
siege B-Attack-T 
than O 
in O 
negotiating O 
peace O 
settlements O 

what O 
do O 
you O 
think O 
caused O 
his B-Target 
illness O 
, O 
and O 
could O 
it O 
have O 
been O 
something O 
malicious O 
( O 
like O 
poisoning B-Attack-T 

and O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
but O 
then O 
-- O 
edwards B-Attacker 
fought B-Attack-T 
back O 
kind O 
of O 
-- O 
you O 
know O 
and O 
then O 
all O 
the O 
stuff O 
you O 
hear O 
about O 
edwards O 
too O 
, O 
about O 
the O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
how O 
he O 
's O 
a O 
trial O 
lawyer O 
and O 
how O 
he O 
made O 
all O 
his O 
millions O 
-- O 
suing O 
insurance O 
companies O 
and O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
you O 
know O 
, O 
there- O 
there O 
's O 
-- O 
bad O 
stuff O 
you O 
hear O 
about O 
both O 
of O 
them O 
that O 
, O 
you O 
know O 
, O 
obviously O 
they O 
want O 
to O 
tell O 
you O 

i O 
think O 
he B-Attacker 
got O 
into O 
an O 
argument O 
with O 
her B-Target 
and O 
he O 
pushed B-Attack-T 
her O 

for O 
example O 
, O 
when O 
there O 
was O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
like O 
, O 
a O 
-- O 
decision O 
against O 
iraq O 
, O 
the O 
united B-Attacker 
states I-Attacker 
-- O 
went O 
directly O 
-- O 
to O 
iraq O 
to O 
-- O 
-- O 
for O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
an O 
invasion B-Attack-T 
-- O 
and O 
-- O 
for O 
-- O 
whatever O 
reasons- O 
-- O 
she O 
even O 
was O 
out O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
putting O 
any O 
attention O 
to O 
the O 
united O 
nations O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
like O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
approval O 

but O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
for O 
israeli B-Attacker 
, O 
palestinian B-Attacker 
conflict B-Attack-T 
there O 
's O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
decisions O 
that O 
has O 
to O 
be O 
-- O 
applied O 
but O 
until O 
now O 
-- O 
she O 
did O 
n't O 
put O 
any O 
pressure O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
toward O 
( O 
( O 
this O 
and O 
) O 
) O 
and O 
i O 
believe O 
this O 
policy O 
has O 
been O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
this O 
kind O 
of O 
policy O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
became O 
more O 
and O 
more O 
during O 
-- O 
eh O 
, O 
during O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
bush O 
-- O 
-- O 
president O 
bush O 
time O 

i O 
believe O 
he O 
-- O 
-- O 
in O 
my O 
opinion O 
he- O 
he O 
was O 
a O 
good O 
leader O 
-- O 
and O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
i O 
believe O 
what O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
has O 
to O 
be O 
done O 
-- O 
right O 
now O 
is O 
to O 
( O 
( O 
apply O 
) O 
) O 
-- O 
the O 
united O 
nations O 
' O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
decisions O 
about O 
the O 
conflict B-Attack-T 
between O 
arab B-Attacker 
and O 
israel B-Attacker 
because O 
there O 
is O 
-- O 
-- O 
there O 
are O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
decisions O 
have O 
been O 
made O 
-- O 
have O 
been O 
made O 
-- O 
and O 
this O 
, O 
uh- O 
for O 
example O 
, O 
one O 
of O 
them O 
was O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
decision O 
number O 
two O 
forty-two O 
-- O 
and O 
this O 
was O 
about O 
-- O 
the O 
ha- O 
establishing O 
two- O 
two O 
countries O 
, O 
one O 
for O 
israel O 
and O 
another O 
one O 
for O 
palestine O 

and O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
yasser O 
arafat O 
was O 
kind O 
of O 
in O 
a O 
difficult O 
position O 
, O 
because O 
you O 
have O 
these O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
incredibly O 
-- O 
oppressed O 
and O 
in O 
some O 
ways O 
imprisoned O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
palestinians O 
, O 
and O 
if O 
-- O 
arafat O 
had O 
n't O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
tried O 
to O 
stand O 
up O 
-- O 
and O 
help O 
them O 
and- O 
and O 
fight B-Attack-T 
for O 
their O 
rights O 
, O 
then O 
-- O 
m- O 
they O 
would O 
n't O 
have O 
respected O 
arafat B-Attacker 
, O 
but O 
then O 
again O 
, O 
you O 
know O 
, O 
he O 
could O 
n't O 
be O 
too O 
friendly O 
with O 
the O 
west O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
and O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
and O 
so O 
he O 
did O 
the O 
best O 
he O 
could O 
, O 
i O 
think O 
. O 
it O 
's O 
a O 
difficult O 
-- O 
leadership O 
role O 

and O 
i O 
-- O 
felt O 
like O 
, O 
hm O 
-- O 
if O 
we O 
're O 
trying O 
to O 
, O 
um O 
-- O 
make O 
-- O 
um O 
-- O 
the O 
united O 
states O 
safer O 
and O 
more O 
stable O 
-- O 
conflict B-Attack-T 
in O 
the O 
world B-Place 
more O 
stable O 
then O 
we O 
probably O 
need O 
somebody O 
-- O 
who O 
is O 
a O 
little O 
bit O 
more O 
-- O 
of O 
a O 
politician O 
in O 
the O 
sense O 
that O 
-- O 
the O 
, O 
they O 
care O 
about O 
diplomacy O 
and O 
-- O 
uh O 
, O 
even O 
though O 
we O 
may O 
not O 
-- O 
give O 
in O 
to O 
-- O 
the O 
will O 
of O 
the O 
other O 
nations O 
present O 
it O 
in O 
a O 
nicer O 
way O 

but O 
do O 
you O 
think O 
, O 
um O 
-- O 
that O 
-- O 
and O 
this O 
is O 
n't O 
quite O 
a O 
political O 
issue O 
, O 
but O 
do O 
you O 
think O 
that O 
-- O 
there O 
's O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
another O 
attack B-Attack-T 
on O 
the O 
~us O 

do O 
you O 
think O 
, O 
um O 
-- O 
the O 
-- O 
when O 
the O 
republicans O 
are O 
campaigning O 
-- O 
they O 
were O 
saying O 
that O 
well O 
, O 
another O 
attack B-Attack-T 
on O 
the O 
u.s. O 
is O 
-- O 
imminent O 
, O 
that O 
it O 
probably O 
-- O 
probably O 
going O 
to O 
happen O 
-- O 
and O 
-- O 
um O 
-- O 
and O 
-- O 
they O 
even O 
went O 
so O 
far O 
to O 
say O 
that O 
if O 
-- O 
it O 
's O 
really O 
difficult O 
to O 
prevent O 
something O 
like O 
this O 
and O 
of O 
course O 
they O 
're O 
doing O 
the O 
best O 
they O 
can O 
and O 
-- O 
i O 
think O 
kerry O 
would O 
do O 
the O 
best O 
he O 
could O 

um O 
-- O 
why O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
now O 
why O 
did O 
they O 
decide O 
that O 
this O 
was O 
to O 
be O 
this O 
big O 
( O 
( O 
) O 
) O 
out O 
of O 
this O 
with O 
the O 
most O 
heinous O 
crime B-Attack-T 
in O 
all O 
of O 
california B-Place 

i O 
mean O 
there O 
's O 
like O 
, O 
genocide B-Attack-T 
in O 
sudan B-Place 
right O 
now O 
but O 
like O 
, O 
nobody O 
talks O 
about O 
that O 

so O 
, O 
if O 
they O 
can O 
just O 
sort O 
of O 
make O 
a O 
-- O 
be- O 
get O 
into O 
more O 
of O 
a O 
supportive O 
role O 
and O 
, O 
you O 
know O 
, O 
flex O 
their O 
muscles O 
when O 
they O 
need O 
to O 
and O 
maybe O 
that O 
will O 
help- O 
help O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
squall O 
some O 
of O 
the O 
vi- O 
the O 
violence B-Attack-T 

yeah O 
, O 
i O 
did O 
at O 
first O 
i O 
just- O 
i O 
just O 
-- O 
i O 
-- O 
do O 
n't O 
like O 
the O 
way O 
it B-Attack-T 
was O 
managed O 

um O 
, O 
yeah O 
, O 
ok- O 
um O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
it O 
was O 
talking O 
something O 
about O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
the O 
war B-Attack-T 
in O 
iraq B-Place 
, O 
um O 
, O 
i O 
guess O 
, O 
yeah O 
, O 
it O 
's O 
a O 
good O 
thing O 
-- O 
about O 
the O 
elections O 
that O 
are O 
going O 
on O 

war B-Attack-T 
in O 
iraq O 

do O 
you O 
support O 
the O 
war B-Attack-T 

do O 
you O 
support O 
the O 
-- O 
do O 
you- O 
do O 
you O 
support O 
the O 
war B-Attack-T 

yeah O 
, O 
i- O 
i O 
mean O 
, O 
i- O 
i O 
did O 
support O 
the O 
war B-Attack-T 

the O 
us B-Attacker 
is O 
currently B-Time-Holds 
engaged O 
in O 
major O 
fighting B-Attack-T 
in O 
fallujah B-Place 
, O 
iraq O 

i O 
think O 
that O 
's O 
why O 
al-qaeda B-Attacker 
-- O 
took B-Attack-T 
down I-Attack-T 
the O 
the O 
uh O 
twin O 
towers B-Target 

i O 
think O 
that O 
it O 
was O 
a O 
front O 
-- O 
for O 
him O 
to O 
allow O 
to O 
to O 
be O 
accepted O 
in O 
an O 
international O 
community O 
, O 
but O 
i O 
think O 
-- O 
that O 
his O 
ultimate O 
plans O 
and O 
goals O 
were O 
to O 
to O 
run O 
the O 
israelis O 
out O 
-- O 
maybe O 
closer O 
to O 
the O 
gaza O 
strip O 
, O 
and O 
to O 
re-take O 
jerusalem B-Place 
-- O 
and O 
other O 
cities B-Place 
near O 
jerusalem O 
, O 
and O 
to O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
uplift O 
his O 
people O 
in O 
a O 
way O 
that O 
-- O 
they O 
could O 
say O 
, O 
you O 
know O 
, O 
we B-Attacker 
conquered B-Attack-T 
the O 
israelis B-Target 

if O 
you O 
know O 
the O 
bible O 
well O 
you O 
would O 
know O 
that O 
there O 
's O 
always O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
a O 
conflict B-Attack-T 
there B-Place 

i O 
'd O 
like O 
to O 
-- O 
i O 
know O 
that O 
, O 
you O 
know O 
, O 
there O 
's O 
been O 
problems O 
, O 
a O 
lot O 
of O 
conflict B-Attack-T 
over O 
there B-Place 
, O 
and O 
it O 
seems O 
like O 
no O 
matter O 
what O 

yeah O 
, O 
and O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
i O 
only O 
know O 
about O 
yasser O 
arafat O 
because O 
i O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
study O 
international O 
affairs O 
a O 
little O 
bit O 
-- O 
and O 
i O 
know O 
-- O 
a O 
very O 
little O 
bit O 
about O 
him O 
because O 
, O 
of O 
course O 
he O 
was O 
a O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
leader O 
for O 
a O 
long O 
time O 
, O 
longer O 
than O 
the O 
age O 
that O 
i O 
am O 
-- O 
old O 
, O 
so O 
, O 
but O 
i- O 
i- O 
i- O 
i O 
've O 
noticed O 
-- O 
on O 
throughout O 
my O 
studies O 
that O 
-- O 
what O 
he O 
represented O 
to O 
the O 
public O 
-- O 
was O 
-- O 
what O 
he O 
represented O 
to O 
the O 
international O 
public O 
-- O 
was O 
not O 
what O 
he O 
was O 
representing O 
to O 
his O 
people O 
-- O 
and O 
he O 
was O 
representing O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
peace O 
with O 
the O 
israelis O 
and O 
he O 
was O 
representing O 
trying O 
to O 
find O 
( O 
( O 
the O 
whites O 
or O 
) O 
) O 
divide O 
the O 
land O 
so O 
that O 
it O 
would O 
be O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
stop O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
war B-Attack-T 
and O 
terrorists O 
in O 
the O 
area B-Place 

it O 
's O 
a O 
matter O 
of O 
, O 
uh O 
-- O 
i O 
mean O 
, O 
it O 
's O 
more O 
than O 
just O 
land O 
, O 
it O 
's O 
a O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
conflict B-Attack-T 
of- O 
-- O 
of O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
hatred O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
and O 
racism O 
, O 
i O 
mean O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
different O 
types O 
of O 
people O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
they B-Attacker 
do O 
n't O 
like O 
each O 
other O 

uh O 
and O 
just O 
wipe B-Attack-T 
it B-Place 
out O 

by O 
going O 
into O 
their O 
territory O 
and O 
building O 
these O 
walls O 
or O 
building O 
settlements O 
-- O 
pushing O 
the O 
palestinians O 
out O 
and O 
-- O 
palestinians B-Attacker 
-- O 
fight B-Attack-T 
-- O 
with O 
rocks B-Instrument 
and O 
-- O 
sticks B-Instrument 
and O 
-- O 
israelis O 
have O 
their O 
machine O 
guns O 
and O 
bulldozers O 
and O 
-- O 
i O 
just O 
-- O 
t- O 
really O 
unpalatable O 
that O 
the O 
-- O 
whole O 
idea O 
, O 
the O 
-- O 
the O 
way O 
they O 
're O 
going O 
about O 
-- O 
this O 
thing O 
and O 
-- O 
i O 
do O 
n't O 
really O 
feel O 
qualified O 
-- O 
to O 
say O 
how O 
it O 
should O 
be O 
, O 
but O 
-- O 
i O 
-- O 
see O 
it O 
-- O 
being O 
wrong O 
to O 
-- O 
hurt O 
children O 
and O 
-- O 
innocent O 
people O 

i O 
i O 
think O 
-- O 
that O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
he O 
-- O 
he O 
's O 
-- O 
pretty O 
much O 
-- O 
-- O 
or O 
he O 
was O 
pretty O 
much O 
-- O 
following O 
what O 
he O 
had O 
always O 
done O 
, O 
even O 
as O 
a O 
young O 
man O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
back O 
in O 
algeria B-Place 
-- O 
when- O 
when O 
he B-Attacker 
led O 
the O 
-- O 
terrorist O 
attacks B-Attack-T 
against O 
the O 
french B-Target 
to O 
kick O 
them O 
out O 
of O 
-- O 
algeria O 

and O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
i O 
think O 
he O 
s- O 
m- O 
was O 
meeting O 
women O 
in O 
the O 
jail O 
like O 
that O 
, O 
too O 
, O 
when O 
he O 
was O 
there O 
, O 
but O 
he O 
just O 
got O 
out O 
of O 
doing O 
fifteen O 
years O 
and O 
, O 
you O 
know O 
, O 
he O 
was O 
just O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
central O 
park O 
, O 
he O 
had O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
well O 
, O 
rough O 
sex O 
or O 
something O 
, O 
with O 
a O 
woman O 
in O 
the O 
park B-Place 
and O 
they O 
said O 
he B-Attacker 
strangled B-Attack-T 
her B-Target 
, O 
or O 

war B-Attack-T 
in O 
iraq B-Place 

yeah O 
, O 
it O 
's O 
all O 
-- O 
you O 
know O 
, O 
i O 
i O 
i O 
do O 
n't O 
know O 
if O 
we O 
're O 
doing O 
the O 
right O 
thing O 
because O 
now O 
look O 
at O 
iran O

i O 
wonder O 
if O 
you O 
could O 
make O 
a O 
case O 
for O 
paying O 
someone O 
to O 
replace B-End-Position-T 
the O 
board O 
member B-Person 
so O 
the O 
board O 
member O 
can O 
attend O 
meetings O 

it O 
ought O 
to O 
be O 
pretty O 
obvious O 
that O 
it O 
would O 
be O 
entirely O 
contrary O 
to O 
the O 
spirit O 
of O 
this O 
for O 
an O 
active O 
board O 
member B-Person 
to O 
be O 
money O 
after O 
leaving B-End-Position-T 
the O 
board O 

i O 
mean O 
, O 
it O 
's O 
conceivable O 
that O 
the O 
other O 
six O 
have O 
all O 
gotten O 
together O 
in O 
marinello O

absence O 
and O 
drafted O 
her O 
, O 
but O 
it O 
also O 
seems O 
pretty O 
clear O 
that O 
she O 
has O 
agreed O 
to O 
do O 
it O 
, O 
and O 
, O 
if O 
all O 
the O 
rumors O 
are O 
true O 
and O 
she B-Person 
steps B-End-Position-T 
down I-End-Position-T 
, O 
it O 
will O 
be O 
so O 
that O 
she O 
can O 
take O 
on O 
these O 
new O 
responsibilities O 

but O 
if O 
we O 
are O 
going O 
to O 
talk O 
about O 
realism O 
, O 
here O 
is O 
another O 
realistic O 
concern O 
: O 
i O 
predict O 
that O 
, O 
if O 
, O 
in O 
fact O 
, O 
the O 
rumors O 
about O 
the O

is O

the O 
immediate O

that O

not O

it O

a O

do O 
this B-Transfer-Money-T

policy O

practice O 
in O

to O

honorarium O 
or O 
stipent O 
for O 
people B-Recipient 
on O

that O

i O 
wonder O 
if O 
you B-Giver

make O 
a O 
case O 
for O 
paying B-Transfer-Money-T 
someone B-Recipient 
to O

someone O 
that O

lives O 
in O

and O 
in O 
the O 
non-profit O 
industry O 
, O 
it B-Transfer-Money-T 
is O 
done O 
, O 
and O 
it O 
is O 
very O 
legal O 

but O 
if O 
we O 
are O 
going O 
to O 
talk O 
about O 
realism O 
, O 
here O 
is O 
another O 
realistic O 
concern O 
: O 
i O 
predict O 
that O 
, O 
if O 
, O 
in O 
fact O 
, O 
the O 
rumors O 
about O 
the O 
agenda O 
for O 
the O 
florida O

prove O 
true O 
, O 
and O 
marinello O 
resigns O 
as O 
president O 
and O 
is O 
hired O 
as O 
move O 
coordinator O 
, O 
the O 
immediate O 
result O 
of O 
this O 
is O 
that O 
sam O 
sloan O 
will O 
file O 
another O 
lawsuit O 
( O 
or O 
amend O

be O 
frozen O 

another O 
argument O 
, O 
which O 
is O 
better O 
but O 
still O 
disturbing O 
, O 
is O 
that O 
, O 
yes O 
, O 
this O 
is O 
an O 
ethics O 
violation O 
, O 
and O 
maybe O 
worse O 
, O 
but O 
it O 
would O 
only O 
hurt O 
the O 
uscf O 
to O 
talk O 
about O 
it O 
, O 
and O 
that O 
only O

, O 
me O 
, O 
would O 
talk O 
about O 
it O 
, O 
since O

so O 
will O 
obstruct O 
the O

the O 
risk O 
of O 
our O 
being O 
stuck O 
without O 
any O 
office O 
space O 
at O 
all O 
, O 
cause O

so O

if O

such O

it O 
is O 
clearly O 
an O

, O 
clearly O 
a O 
violation O 
of O

, O 
possibly O

a O 
violation O 
of O

well O 

it O 
's O 
irrelevant O

at O

, O 
you O

the O

the O

that O

down I-Meet-T 
an- O

be O 
in O 
touch O 
with O

something O

, O 
that O 

for O 
example O 
, O 
before O 
, O 
eh O 
, O 
during O 
clinton O 
, O 
i O 
believe O 
at O 
that O

clinton O 
was O 
trying O 
hard O 
-- O 
to O 
solve O 
this O

, O 
if O 
you O 
remember O 
, O 
um O 
, O 
yasser B-Entity

uh O 
, O 
the O 
prime O

they O 
met B-Meet-T 
together O 
in O 
the O 
white B-Place 
house I-Place 
-- O 
and O 
-- O 
they O 
almost O 
came O 
to O 
an O 
agreement O

to O 
solve O 
this O 
problem O 
-- O 
and O 
during O 
clinton O

eh O 
, O 
period O 
-- O 
they O 
had O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
this O 
( O 
( O 
oslo O

) O 
a- O 
eh O 
, O 
agreement O 

and O 
all O 
the O 
meetings B-Meet-T 
he B-Entity 
's O 
missing O 
, O 
and O 
just O 
, O 
you O 
know O 
, O 
i O 
think O 
it O 
's O 
more O 
of O 
a O 
status O 
quo O 
for O 
him O 

they B-Entity 
had O 
those O 
retreats B-Meet-T 
and O 
things O 
with O 
the O 
leaders B-Entity 

so O 
i O 
went O 
and O 
volunteered O 
for O 
him O 
and O 
everything O 
, O 
and O 
-- O 
and O 
i B-Entity 
met B-Meet-T 
hillary B-Entity 
, O 
and O 
and O 
tipper B-Entity 
and O 
al B-Entity 
, O 
and O 
and O 
i O 
almost O 
got O 
to O 
meet O 
him O 

do O 
you B-Entity

visit B-Meet-T 

you O 
know O 
, O 
we B-Entity 
have O 
to O 
meet B-Meet-T

when O 
i B-Entity 
offered O 
to O 
attend O 
the O

meeting B-Meet-T 
in O 
october B-Time-Within 
2003 I-Time-Within 
to O

clarify O 
all O 
this O 
, O 
i O 
was O 
told O 
i O 
was O 
not O 
welcome O 

we B-Entity 
are O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
having O 
a O 
sock O 
painting O 
party O 
at O 
my O 
house O 
instead O 
of O 
the O 
normal O 
meeting B-Meet-T 
at O 
st. B-Place 
mary I-Place 
's O 

the O 
foreign O 
minister O 
of O 
north O 
korea O 
has O 
state O 
that O 
north O 
korea O 
has O 
nuclear O 
weapons O 
and O 
has O 
officially O 
with O 
drawn O 
from O 
the O 
6 O 
nation B-Entity 
talks B-Meet-T 
on O

in O

what O 
is O 
the O 
recommended O 
policy O 
on O 
compensating O 
board O 
members B-Entity 
for O 
attending O 
meetings B-Meet-T 
, O 
when O 
they O 
have O 
no O

, O

what O

the O 
board B-Entity

on O 
their O 
own O 
time O 
, O 
without O 
pay O 

i O 
wonder O 
if O 
you O 
could O 
make O 
a O 
case O 
for O 
paying O 
someone O 
to O 
replace O 
the O 
board O 
member O 
so O 
the O 
board B-Entity 
member O 
can O 
attend O 
meetings B-Meet-T 

another O 
possibility O 
is O 
to O 
change O 
the O 
meeting B-Meet-T 
times O 

in O 
fairness O 
, O 
reimbursement O 
of O 
out-of-pocket O 
expenses O 
on O 
behalf O 
of O 
the O 
organization O 
-- O 
including O 
travel O 
and O 
lodging O 
to O 
attend O 
board B-Entity 
meetings B-Meet-T 
-- O 
are O 
allowed O 

it O 
is O 
very O 
difficult O 
to O 
find O 
times O 
for O 
all O 
of O 
us B-Entity 
to O 
get O 
together B-Meet-T 

but O 
if O 
we O 
are O 
going O 
to O 
talk O 
about O 
realism O 
, O 
here O 
is O 
another O 
realistic O 
concern O 
: O 
i O 
predict O 
that O 
, O 
if O 
, O 
in O 
fact O 
, O 
the O 
rumors O 
about O 
the O 
agenda O 
for O 
the O 
florida B-Place 
meeting B-Meet-T 
prove O 
true O 
, O 
and O 
marinello O 
resigns O 
as O 
president O 
and O 
is O 
hired O 
as O 
move O 
coordinator O 
, O 
the O 
immediate O 
result O 
of O 
this O 
is O 
that O 
sam O 
sloan O 
will O 
file O 
another O 
lawsuit O 
( O 
or O 
amend O 
his O 
current O 
complaint O 
) O 
charging O 
the O 
uscf O 
eb O 
members O 
with O 
self-dealing O 
, O 
violation O 
of O 
the O 
uscf O 
's O 
own O 
bylaws O 
, O 
and O 
every O 
other O 
thing O 
, O 
report O 
us O 
to O 
the O 
irs O 
, O 
and O 
demand O 
that O 
all O 
uscf O 
moneys O 
which O 
might O 
be O 
used O 
to O 
paid O 
marinello O 
be O 
frozen O 

furthermore O 
, O 
it O 
does O 
n't O 
matter O 
whether O 
this O 
arrangement O 
is O 
embodied O 
in O 
an O 
eb O 
vote O 
or O 
not O 
, O 
or O 
whether O 
the O 
discussion O 
of O 
the O 
proposal O 
takes O 
place O 
in O 
a O 
formal O 
eb B-Entity 
meeting B-Meet-T 
or O 
not O 

also O 
, O

of O 
how O 
he B-Artifact 
got B-Transport-T 
to O 
washington B-Destination 
, O 
d.c. O 
, O 
is O 
compelling O 
for O 
several O 
reasons O

starting O 
with O 
how O 
close O 
he O 
came O 
to O 
not O 
being O 
here O 
at O 
all O 

those O 
pilots B-Artifact 
were O 
captured O 
on O

24th I-Time-Within 
, O 
after O

down I-Transport-T

i B-Artifact

, O 
i O 
'm O 
going O

tonight O 
, O 
i O 
really O 
am O 

now O 
they O 
are O 
learning O 
more O 
details O 
that O 
their O 
son O 
in O 
fact O 
was O 
kicked O 
and O 
beaten O 
after O 
his O 
capture O 
, O 
and O 
that O 
his O 
fellow O 
pilot O 
david O 
williams O 
had O 
a O 
knife O 
held O 
to O 
his O 
throat O 
immediately O 
after O 
an O 
tur O 
, O 
according O 
to O 
an O 
interview O 
their O 
son O 
was O 
allowed O 
to O 
conduct O 
with O 
`` O 
the O 
washington O 
post O 
'' O 
, O 
who O 
flew B-Transport-T 
with O 
him B-Artifact 
into O 
kuwait B-Destination 

then O 
if O 
we B-Artifact 
stay O 
there B-Destination 
for O 
about O 
a O 
year O 
or O 
two O 
, O 
the O 
whole O 
trip B-Transport-T 
could O 
last O 
about B-Time-Holds 
three I-Time-Holds 
years I-Time-Holds 

the O 
nasa O 
and O 
the O 
european B-Agent 
space I-Agent 
agency I-Agent 
both O 
launch O 
missions B-Transport-T 
to O 
mars B-Destination 
this B-Time-Within 
month I-Time-Within 
sending O 
rovers B-Vehicle 
and O 
ashters B-Vehicle 
to O 
probe O 
the O 
red O 
planet O 

looks O 
like O 
it O 
will O 
be O 
some O 
time O 
before O 
we O 
make O 
our B-Artifact 
way B-Transport-T 
to O 
mars B-Destination 

the O 
bigger O 
issue O 
is O 
once O 
we B-Artifact 
get B-Transport-T 
there B-Destination 
, O 
we O 
ca O 
n't O 
carry O 
oxygen O 
or O 
water O 
or O 
food O 
to O 
stay O 
there O 
three O 
years O 
, O 
so O 
we O 
're O 
going O 
to O 
have O 
to O 
do O 
all O 
of O 
that O 
on O 
the O 
surface O 
of O 
the O 
planet O 

so O 
what O 
's O 
the O 
difficulty O 
in O 
being O 
able O 
to O 
go B-Transport-T 
to O 
mars B-Destination 

it O 
was O 
only O 
about B-Time-Within 
30 I-Time-Within 
years I-Time-Within 
ago I-Time-Within 
when O 
we B-Artifact 
went B-Transport-T 
to O 
the O 
moon B-Destination 

you B-Agent 
'd O 
have O 
to O 
launch B-Transport-T 
is B-Artifact 
from O 
in O 
space B-Origin 
already O 
, O 
which O 
means O 
we O 
would O 
have O 
to O 
build O 
it O 
in O 
space O 

the O 
nasa O 
and O 
the O 
european O 
space O 
agency O 
both O 
launch O 
missions O 
to O 
mars B-Destination 
this B-Time-Within 
month I-Time-Within 
sending B-Transport-T 
rovers B-Artifact 
and O 
ashters B-Artifact 
to O 
probe O 
the O 
red O 
planet O 

then O 
we O 
have O 
to O 
come O 
up O 
with O 
the O 
fuel O 
that O 
will O 
take B-Transport-T 
it B-Artifact 
out O 
of O 
the O 
earth O 
's O 
orbit O 
all O 
the O 
way O 
to O 
mars B-Destination 

one O 
of O 
the O 
big O 
questions O 
about O 
mars B-Destination 
is O 
when O 
or O 
whether O 
humans B-Artifact 
will O 
ever O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
visit B-Transport-T 

well O 
, O 
first O 
of O 
all O 
, O 
the O 
spacecraft B-Artifact 
would O 
not O 
be O 
launched B-Transport-T 
from O 
earth B-Origin 

for O 
the B-Time-Holds 
next I-Time-Holds 
12 I-Time-Holds 
hours I-Time-Holds 
into I-Time-Holds 
the B-Time-Ending 
morning I-Time-Ending 
, O 
planes B-Vehicle 
from O 
the O 
carrier O 
will O 
fly B-Transport-T 
missions O 
over O 
afghanistan B-Destination 

we B-Artifact 
came B-Transport-T 
across I-Transport-T 
a O 
checkpoint B-Destination 
and O 
there O 
were O 
about O 
maybe O 
five O 
, O 
six O 
iraqi O 
locals O 
with O 
ak-47 O 
machine O 
guns O 
and O 
checking O 
cars O 

on O 
april B-Time-Within 
9th I-Time-Within 
, O 
about O 
130 O 
journalists B-Artifact 
from O 
around O 
the O 
world O 
including O 
myself O 
and O 
a O 
couple O 
of O

, O 
we O 
were O 
going O 
to O 
try O 
to O 
cross B-Transport-T 
the O 
border B-Destination 
because O 
we O 
were O 
all O 
desperate O 
to O 
get O 
into O 
iraq O 
, O 
two B-Time-At-End 
days I-Time-At-End 
after I-Time-At-End 
the I-Time-At-End 
saddam I-Time-At-End 
statue I-Time-At-End 
fell I-Time-At-End

we O 
all O

it O 
was O 
over O 

but O 
instead O 
, O 
2,000 B-Artifact 
showed B-Transport-T 
up I-Transport-T 
because O 
they O 
heard O 
about O 
it O 
on O 
the O 
radio O 

so O 
we B-Artifact 
went B-Transport-T 
into O 
this O 
bunker B-Destination 
hoping O 
to O 
find O 
a O 
prison O 
and O 
run O 
into O

instead O 
we O

just O 
hope O 
and O 
pray O 
that O 
congress O

quickly O 
pass O 
the O

that O 
those O 
children O 
will O 
have O 
a O 
better O 
chance O 
because O 
they B-Artifact

the O

a O

the O

that O 
suggests O 
that O 
the O

get B-Transport-T 
to O 
baghdad B-Destination 
and O 
tikrit O 
the O

the O 
likelihood O 
and O 
that O 
some O

have O 
been O 
put O 
in O

u.s. O 
officials O

these O 
guys B-Artifact 
over O 
there B-Destination 
and O 
you O 
want O

-- O 
i O 
just O

t- O 
really O 
unpalatable O 
that O 
the O 
-- O 
whole O 
idea O 
, O 
the O 
-- O 
the O 
way O 
they O 
're O 
going O 
about O

this O 
thing O 
and O 
-- O 
i O 
do O 
n't O 
really O 
feel O 
qualified O 
-- O 
to O 
say O 
how O 
it O 
should O 
be O 
, O 
but O 
-- O 
i O 
-- O 
see O 
it O 
-- O 
being O 
wrong O 
to O 
-- O 
hurt O 
children O

-- O 
innocent O 
people O 

well O 
, O 
you O 
know O 
, O

well O 
, O 
my O 
grandparents O 
came O 
over O 
, O 
ellis O 
island O 
and O 
everything O

but O 
when O 
i O 
think O 
about O 
, O 
you O 
know O 
, O 
a O 
foreign O 
person B-Artifact 
or O 
maybe O 
born O 
in O 
another O 
country B-Origin 
and O 
coming B-Transport-T 
here B-Destination 
it O 
doe- O 
it O 
does O 
n't O 
seem O 
right O 
in O 
one O 
sense O 
for O 
-- O 
for O 
them O 
to O 
be O 
able O 
to O 
be O 
president O 
of O 
this O 
country O 

he O 
did O 
n't O 
get O 
his O 
papers O 
where O 
he O 
's O 
going O 
to O 
be O 
c- O 
-- O 
he O 
's O 
in O 
upstate O 
new B-Origin 
york I-Origin 
right O 
now O 
but O

to O 
probably O 
go B-Transport-T 
back I-Transport-T 
to- O 
to O 
either O 
iraq B-Destination 
or O 
af- O 
afghanistan B-Destination 

he O 
was O 
in O 
the O 
army O 
and O 
he B-Artifact 
's O 
going O 
to O 
probably O 
be O 
going B-Transport-T 
to O 
afghanistan B-Destination 
he O 
told O 
me O 

well O 
, O 
i O 
have O 
a O 
nephew O 
, O 
he B-Artifact 
just O 
got B-Transport-T 
back I-Transport-T 
from O 
iraq B-Origin 

i- O 
i O 
did O 
n't O 
know O 
they B-Agent 
could O 
send B-Transport-T 
them B-Artifact 
more O 
than O 
once O 

you O 
know O 
, O 
we O 
have O 
to O 
meet O 
with O 
uh O 
-- O 
people B-Artifact 
that O 
come B-Transport-T 
to O 
~k O 
mart O 
or O 
sam O 
's O 
club O 

i O 
mean O 
, O 
we O 
go O 
over O 
whatever O 
-- O 
whatever O 
has O 
to O 
be O 
-- O 
talked O 
about O 
that O 
day O 
, O 
and O 
then O 
they O 
're O 
all O 
we B-Artifact 
just O 
kind O 
of O 
-- O 
go B-Transport-T 
out O 
and O 
do O 
our O 
appointments O 
in O 
the B-Time-Within 
afternoon I-Time-Within 
, O 
or O 
in O 
the B-Time-Within 
evenings I-Time-Within 

so O 
you O 
were O 
in O 
pittsburgh B-Origin 
, O 
and O 
you B-Agent 
went B-Transport-T 
a O 
hundred O 
miles O 
to O 
the O 
south O 
, O 
or O 
eighty O 
miles O 
south O 
, O 
you B-Artifact 
'd O 
be O 
in O 
fairmont B-Destination 

yeah O 
, O 
i B-Artifact 
did O 
go B-Transport-T 
through O 
-- O 
west B-Destination 
virginia I-Destination 
, O 
one O 
time O 
through O 
-- O 
from O 
pittsburgh B-Origin 

i O 
had O 
relatives O 
that O 
lived O 
outside O 
of O 
pittsburgh O 
, O 
once O 
, O 
and O 
i B-Artifact 
went B-Transport-T 
to O 
florida B-Destination 
from O 
there B-Origin 
, O 
so O 
i O 
did O 
go O 
through O 
west O 
virginia O 

i O 
had O 
relatives O 
that O 
lived O 
outside O 
of O 
pittsburgh O 
, O 
once O 
, O 
and O 
i O 
went O 
to O 
florida B-Destination 
from O 
there B-Origin 
, O 
so O 
i B-Artifact 
did O 
go B-Transport-T 
through O 
west O 
virginia O 

um O 
, O 
actually O 
, O 
usually O 
we B-Artifact 
're O 
out B-Transport-T 
of O 
town B-Origin 
so O 
we O 
do O 
n't O 
attend O 
our O 
church O 

it O 
's O 
not O 
like O 
you B-Artifact 
just O 
go O 
and O 
eat O 
dinner O 
a B-Time-At-End 
couple I-Time-At-End 
of I-Time-At-End 
hours I-Time-At-End 
and O 
go B-Transport-T 
home B-Destination 

your O 
gran- O 
you B-Artifact 
go B-Transport-T 
to O 
your O 
grandma O 
's O 
house B-Destination 

but O 
, O 
still O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
they B-Artifact 
go B-Transport-T 
to O 
, O 
uh O 
, O 
grandmother O 
's O 
-- O 
every O 
christmas O 

but O 
it O 
was O 
n't O 
-- O 
like O 
, O 
ah O 
, O 
was O 
n't O 
bush O 
, O 
i B-Agent 
definitely O 
would O 
n't O 
send B-Transport-T 
him B-Artifact 
, O 
i O 
do O 
n't O 
think O 
you O 
want O 
to O 
have O 
him O 
in O 
that O 
part B-Destination 
of O 
the O 
world O 
right O 
now O 

um O 
, O 
you O 
know O 
, O 
you- O 
e- O 
-- O 
granted O 
, O 
you O 
know O 
, O 
there O 
were O 
there O 
were O 
jewish O 
people O 
already O 
living O 
there O 
, O 
but O 
-- O 
all O 
the O 
jewish O 
people B-Artifact 
started O 
going B-Transport-T 
there B-Destination 
and O 
they O 
j- O 
basically O 
just- O 
you O 
know O 
, O 
they O 
just O 
took O 
over O 

to O 
go B-Transport-T 
out O 
of O 
the O 
country B-Origin 
as O 
part O 
of O 
our B-Artifact 
new O 
year O 
's O 

so O 
-- O 
keep O 
it O 
together O 
through O 
thick O 
and O 
thin O 
and O 
-- O 
when O 
it O 
comes O 
to O 
thanksgiving O 
we B-Artifact 
go B-Transport-T 
up O 
there B-Destination 
and O 
we O 
celebrate O 

well O 
, O 
the O 
homeless O 
people B-Artifact 
-- O 
i O 
guess O 
, O 
they O 
need O 
their O 
shopping O 
cart O 
, O 
so O 
they O 
kind O 
of O 
went B-Transport-T 
elsewhere O 
, O 
so O 
-- O 
um O 
-- O 
i O 
mean O 
it O 
's O 
a O 
small O 
thing O 
, O 
but O 
it O 
was O 
, O 
they O 
just O 
figured O 
out O 
, O 
they O 
were O 
-- O 
you O 
know O 
, O 
uh O 
-- O 
learning O 
from O 
experience O 
on O 
what O 
they O 
need O 
to O 
do O 
in O 
the O 
-- O 
city O 
and O 
-- O 
i O 
think O 
he O 
would O 
be O 
a O 
good O 
-- O 
candidate O 
for O 
the O 
homeland O 
security O 
, O 
running O 
that O 

eventually O 
, O 
after O 
prolonged O 
violent O 
opposition O 
de O 
lozada O 
? O 
s O 
plan O 
to O 
sell O 
bolivia O 
's O 
natural O 
gas O 
exports O 
at O 
? O 
give-away O 
prices O 
? O 
through O 
multinational O 
middlemen O 
, O 
de B-Artifact 
lozada I-Artifact 
resigned O 
and O 
fled B-Transport-T 
the O 
country B-Origin 
on O 
october B-Time-Within 
17 I-Time-Within 
, I-Time-Within 
2003 I-Time-Within 

so O 
you B-Artifact 
're O 
basically O 
free O 
, O 
with O 
the O 
expectation O 
that O 
you O 
will O 
not O 
leave B-Transport-T 
the O 
state B-Origin 
( O 
assuming O 
you O 
've O 
been O 
jailed O 
by O 
the O 
state O 
gov't O 
) O 
and O 
you O 
have O 
to O 
check O 
in O 
with O 
your O 
parole O 
officer O 
on O 
a O 
regular O 
basis O 
( O 
i O 
think O 
they O 
give O 
you O 
a O 
schedule O 

and O 
, O 
specifically O 
, O 
who B-Agent 
takes B-Transport-T 
you B-Artifact 
home B-Destination 
once O 
you O 
get O 
out O 
of O 
jail O 
, O 
or O 
do O 
you O 
just O 
get O 
turfed O 
out O 
and O 
expected O 
to O 
check O 
in O 
with O 
your O 
parole O 
officer O 
the O 
next O 
day O 

consequently O 
, O 
for O 
the O 
ph O 
conspiracy O 
theorists O 
to O 
believe O 
that O 
fdr O 
kept O 
the O 
carriers O 
out O 
of O 
harm O 
's O 
way O 
, O 
we O 
not O 
only O 
have O 
to O 
grant O 
fdr O 
the O 
full O 
knowledge O 
of O 
kido O 
butai O 
's O 
route O 
of O 
approach O 
would O 
not O 
result O 
in O 
either O 
usn O 
carrier O 
fleet O 
getting O 
caught O 
in O 
a O 
hopeless O 
battle O 
, O 
but O 
that O 
fdr O 
could O 
psychically O 
manipulate O 
the O 
weather O 
to O 
prevent O 
halsey B-Artifact 
from O 
sailing B-Transport-T 
into O 
pearl B-Destination 
and O 
thus O 
be O 
ambushed O 

however O 
, O 
the O 
two O 
carriers B-Vehicle 
operating O 
out O 
of O 
pearl B-Origin 
at O 
the O 
moment O 
were O 
sent B-Transport-T 
west O 
with O 
light O 
escort O 
, O 
on O 
possibly O 
intersecting O 
routes O 
with O 
the O 
ijn O 
kido O 
butai O 
, O 
which O 
had O 
far O 
more O 
carriers O 
and O 
a O 
far O 
heavier O 
escort O 

it O 
is O 
no O 
coincidence O 
that O 
the O 
employees O 
let O 
go O 
included O 
substantially O 
all O 
those O 
who B-Artifact 
had O 
offered O 
to O 
transfer B-Transport-T 
to O 
crossville B-Destination 
, O 
including O 
( O 
remarkably O 
) O 
the O 
employee O 
of O 
the O 
year O 

therefore O 
, O 
on O 
august B-Time-Within 
20 I-Time-Within 
, I-Time-Within 
2003 I-Time-Within 
, O 
bravely O 
beatriz B-Artifact 
walked B-Transport-T 
into O 
the O 
uscf O 
offices B-Destination 
in O 
new O 
windsor O 
and O 
immediately O 
fired O 
17 O 
staff O 
members O 

some O 
hmong B-Artifact 
americans I-Artifact 
may O 
be O 
reintroduced B-Transport-T 
to O 
laos B-Destination 

we B-Agent 
take B-Transport-T 
our O 
own O 
cars B-Vehicle 
to O 
every O 
tournament O 
, O 
even O 
ones O 
down O 
in O 
maryland B-Destination 

no O 
, O 
they O 
do O 
n't O 
. O 
the O 
`` O 
suspicious O 
evidence O 
'' O 
is O 
simply O 
that O 
arafat O 
did O 
not O 
look O 
particularly O 
near O 
death O 
when O 
he B-Artifact 
was O 
removed B-Transport-T 
from O 
his O 
hq B-Origin 

so O 
if O 
the O 
us B-Agent 
leaves B-Transport-T 
its O 
possible O 
we O 
could O 
see O 
iraq B-Origin 
carved O 
up O 
between O 
the O 
groups O 

took O 
the O 
underground O 
to O 
victoria B-Origin 
, O 
and O 
walked B-Transport-T 
to O 
the O 
victoria B-Destination 
coach I-Destination 
station I-Destination 
( O 
it O 
's O 
not O 
the O 
same O 

we O 
had O 
been O 
buying O 
the O 
2-zone O 
all-day O 
tube O 
passes O 
( O 
4.20 O 
gbp O 
each O 
) O 
everyday O 
, O 
just O 
to O 
get O 
around O 
to O 
dinner O 
and O 
shopping O 
on O 
our O 
own O 
, O 
but O 
by O 
the O 
time O 
this O 
was O 
all O 
over O 
, O 
my O 
wife O 
did O 
n't O 
feel O 
like O 
taking O 
the O 
underground O 
back O 
to O 
heathrow O 
, O 
so O 
we O 
had O 
asked O 
the O 
hotel O 
conceierge B-Agent 
to O 
make O 
a O 
reservation O 
on O 
an O 
airport O 
bus O 
( O 
15 O 
gbp O 
each O 
) O 
, O 
but O 
he O 
instead O 
offered O 
that O 
he O 
could O 
get O 
us B-Artifact 
a O 
private O 
car B-Vehicle 
direct B-Transport-T 
to O 
the O 
airport B-Destination 
for O 
35 O 
gbp O 
, O 
which O 
is O 
what O 
we O 
did O 

i B-Artifact 
would O 
n't O 
have O 
done O 
that B-Transport-T 
from O 
lhr B-Origin 
to O 
the O 
hotel B-Destination 
, O 
but O 
since O 
the O 
concierge O 
was O 
arranging O 
it O 
, O 
i O 
felt O 
that O 
it O 
'd O 
be O 
safe O 
, O 
and O 
the O 
driver O 
turned O 
out O 
to O 
be O 
pretty O 
nice O 

this O 
was O 
perfect O 
, O 
because O 
it B-Vehicle 
got B-Transport-T 
us B-Artifact 
door-to-door O 
from O 
the O 
hotel B-Origin 
to O 
lhr O 
terminal B-Destination 
3 I-Destination 
with O 
no O 
hassles O 
at O 
all O 

after O 
that O 
, O 
we B-Artifact 
took B-Transport-T 
the O 
underground B-Vehicle 
into O 
london B-Destination 

we O 
were O 
n't O 
sure O 
what O 
we O 
wanted O 
to O 
eat O 
for O 
dinner O 
, O 
so O 
we B-Artifact 
just O 
wandered O 
around O 
a O 
bit O 
, O 
and O 
finally O 
ended B-Transport-T 
up I-Transport-T 
at O 
a O 
`` O 
steakhouse B-Destination 
'' O 
near O 
the O 
station O 
... O 
big O 
mistake O 

took B-Transport-T 
the O 
underground B-Vehicle 
to O 
victoria B-Destination 
, O 
and O 
walked O 
to O 
the O

( O 
it O

not O 
the O

we B-Artifact 
*just* O 
got B-Transport-T 
back I-Transport-T 
into O

last B-Time-Within 
evening I-Time-Within 
, O 
after O 
our O 
brief O 
5-day O

as O 
we O

it O 
was O 
the O

way O 
to O 
get B-Transport-T 
around O

when O
