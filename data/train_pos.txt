it O PRP O

Is O VBZ O
that O IN O
where B-Government WRB B-Entity

, O , O
my B-Individual PRP$ O
first O JJ O
call O NN B-Phone-Write-T
I B-Individual PRP B-Entity
got O VBD O
was O VBD O
from O IN O
Russia B-Nation NNP B-Place

would O MD O
you B-Indeterminate PRP O
appoint O VB B-Start-Position-T

your B-Indeterminate PRP$ O
cabinet B-Group NN O

why O WRB O

I B-Individual PRP O

that O DT O
's O VBZ O
why O WRB O
Al-Qaeda B-Non-Governmental NNP B-Attacker
-- O : O
took O VBD B-Attack-T
down O RP I-Attack-T
the O DT O
the O DT O
uh O UH O
twin O JJ O

Ashcroft B-Individual NNP O
surprised O VBD O
me B-Individual PRP O
a O DT O
little O JJ O
bit O NN O
um O NN O
but O CC O
um O NN O
I B-Individual PRP O
sort O VBP O
of O IN O
started O VBN O
to O TO O
think O VB O
he B-Individual PRP B-Person
might O MD O
step O VB B-End-Position-T
down O RB I-End-Position-T
because O RB O
evidently O RB O
he B-Individual PRP O
was O VBD O
being O VBG O
he B-Individual PRP O
was O VBD O
considered O VBN O
somewhat O RB O
of O IN O
a O DT O
lightning O NN O
rod B-Individual NN O
for O IN O
um O NN O
you B-Indeterminate PRP O
know O VBP O
some O DT O
of O IN O
his B-Individual PRP$ O
more O JJR O
controversial O JJ O
stands O NNS O
and O CC O
stuff O NN O
so O RB O

Oh O UH O
thi- O IN O
you B-Individual PRP O
were O VBD O

yo- O VBP O
that O IN O
he B-Individual PRP B-Person
decided O VBD O

y- O VB O
what O WP O
would O MD O
you B-Individual PRP O
appoint O VB B-Start-Position-T
him B-Individual PRP B-Person

for O IN O
him B-Individual PRP O
to O TO O
allow O VB O

in O IN O
an O DT O
international O JJ O

but O CC O
I B-Individual PRP O

that O IN O
his B-Individual PRP$ O

were O VBD O
to O TO O
to O TO O
